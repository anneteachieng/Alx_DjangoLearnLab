# Tagging and Search Features

## 🔖 Tagging Posts
- You can add tags to your blog posts when creating or editing them.
- Tags help organize posts by topic and make content more discoverable.

### How to Use:
- When creating/editing a post, use the "Tags" field to add tags (e.g., `Python`, `Django`, `Tutorial`).
- Tags can be reused and are linked to multiple posts.

## 🔍 Searching Posts
- A search bar is located in the site header.
- You can search posts by:
  - Title
  - Content
  - Tags

### How to Use:
- Type your search query into the search bar and press "Search".
- Matching posts will be displayed on the search results page.

## 📎 Example URLs
- View posts by tag: `/tags/<tag_name>/`
- Perform a search: `/search/?q=django`

## 🧪 Testing
